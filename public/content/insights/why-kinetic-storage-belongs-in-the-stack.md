Every storage technology occupies a slice of the time spectrum. Lithium dominates the hour-scale domain. Generators and turbines handle minutes to days. Capacitors handle microseconds.

Flywheels sit in the sub-five-minute range—where neither batteries nor generators operate efficiently.

This is where volatility lives:

- GPU clusters spinning up
- EV fast chargers snapping online
- Microgrid transitions
- Faults, flicker, sag, and surge

A kinetic system doesn't care about cycle count. It doesn't degrade from rapid oscillation. It responds at the speed of mechanical torque exchange. This is why we're building Rotor-Seed and Rotor-Pod: not as replacements for lithium, but as the missing layer that makes lithium and the grid behave predictably.
