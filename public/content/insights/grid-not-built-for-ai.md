title: "The Grid Is Not Built for AI"

summary: "AI compute demand is scaling faster than the grid's ability to respond. The physics under the system were never designed for this type of load behavior."

AI workloads aren't just increasing electricity demand. They are reshaping the shape of demand. The grid was built around slow-changing loads: factories, HVAC, lighting, the kind of consumption that ramps over minutes or hours. AI inference doesn't behave like that. It steps like compute—millisecond bursts, coordinated training cycles, and synchronization events across thousands of GPUs.

The grid has no "fast nervous system" to react to those jumps. Transformers saturate. Voltage sags. Frequency deviations cascade. And everywhere you look, utilities are trying to solve a 2025 problem with 1950s architecture.

This mismatch is why volatility, not capacity, is becoming the real constraint. What AI is doing to the grid is similar to what high-frequency trading did to finance: exposing where the infrastructure was never designed for this kind of temporal behavior.

We built On The Fly Energy because this volatility isn't going away—it's multiplying.
