Three-phase power is one of the most elegant engineering solutions ever invented. A rotating magnetic field passing by three coils creates three voltages separated by 120 degrees. That geometry is the reason motors start smoothly, generators stay stable, and power flows efficiently.

But here's the part most people miss: **phase balance is fragile**.

When AI loads snap online, or fast chargers ramp, the symmetry breaks. Voltage sags appear unevenly. Neutral currents rise. Transformers heat irregularly. These distortions ripple through everything, from industrial equipment to data center busways.

Understanding the geometry behind phases is critical because the next decade of electrification depends on maintaining that symmetry under conditions it was never designed for.

That's why our educational series starts here.
