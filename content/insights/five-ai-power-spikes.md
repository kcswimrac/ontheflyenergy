AI data centers stress the grid in ways traditional compute never did. The instability comes from five core behaviors:

1. **Synchronized startup spikes** across GPU clusters
2. **Training cycle oscillations** every few minutes
3. **Inference bursts** with millisecond-scale edges
4. **Cooling-step surges** from thermal management
5. **Transformer recharge dips** after high-load pulses

Each of these creates volatility far out of proportion to the raw kilowatt-hours consumed. The "shape" of demand is what breaks infrastructure—not the volume.

This is why AI is accelerating grid upgrades, interconnection delays, and curtailment. And it's why sub-minute buffering will become a mandatory capability for next-generation data centers.
