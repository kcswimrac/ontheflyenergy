summary: "Most storage companies treat the inverter as a commodity. We can't. Responsiveness, safety, and control all originate in the power electronics."

Most storage startups outsource their inverters. It's faster, but it's a trap. If your power electronics are generic, your system becomes generic. Worse, you inherit every limitation of hardware built for solar, not volatility.

Flywheels demand a different profile:

- **Fast torque response**
- **Low-latency bidirectional flow**
- **Predictable droop behavior**
- **Direct control over rotor dynamics**

The inverter isn't just a connector between AC and DC—it's the nervous system of the entire kinetic storage module.

This is why we're designing our own architecture. It's how we unlock the performance envelope that lithium-based storage can't reach.
