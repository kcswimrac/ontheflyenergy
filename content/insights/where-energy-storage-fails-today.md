Lithium batteries are engineered to store energy. That makes them powerful, flexible, and scalable—but it also means they're mismatched to the most violent parts of grid behavior.

High C-rate discharge destroys cycle life. Fast ramping heats cells unevenly. Repeated micro-cycling becomes disproportionally expensive. You pay for energy density but use the battery as a power buffer, and the economics collapse.

This is why so many BESS deployments underperform in real-world duty cycles. The physics are sound for storage. They are unsound for volatility.

Every storage technology has a time domain where it excels. Lithium is hours. Supercaps are milliseconds. Flywheels live in the forgotten space between.
